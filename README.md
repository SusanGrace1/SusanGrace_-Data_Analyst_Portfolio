### Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and identify the key factors that correlate with the gross earnings of movies. By understanding these correlations, we can make educated guesses and strategic decisions that could potentially maximize a movie's financial success.

### Data Source

I sourced my dataset for this project from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)

### Tools and Technologies

- Python- Programming Langage
- Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data Visualization
- Pandas & numpy - Data Manipulation, Data Cleaning, Removing Duplicates and Data Aggregation.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Before diving into the data analysis, we made the following educated guesses based on industry knowledge and logical reasoning:

1. **Budget:** We assumed that a higher budget would result in higher gross earnings.

2. **Company:** We believed that movies produced by more prestigious or larger companies would have higher budgets and, consequently, higher gross earnings.

### Code: 

The  for this project was mainly for data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.
